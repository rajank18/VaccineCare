VaccineCare is an innovative vaccination management platform developed during the Vaccine Care Hackathon by our team, Neural Nexus. The project aims to streamline the vaccination process for parents, hospitals, and government authorities by providing a seamless mobile and web-based solution.

Key Features:
âœ… Mobile App for Parents:

Sends automated reminders for upcoming vaccinations.

Provides access to digital vaccination certificates.

âœ… Web Portal for Hospitals & Government:

Hospitals can upload and manage vaccination records, including certificates.

Government authorities can verify vaccination details and maintain centralized records.

Secure storage and easy retrieval of vaccination history.

By bridging the gap between parents, healthcare providers, and the government, VaccineCare ensures efficient vaccine tracking, verification, and accessibility while promoting digital health records for infants and children. ðŸš€
